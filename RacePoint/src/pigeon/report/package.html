      These classes take instances of the model classes and produce reports of different kinds.
      <p/>
      Usually the reports are saved to HTML files which can then be opened by the user's default
      web browser.
      <p/>
      The reporting code is in the process of being upgraded to use XML + XSLT for output.  This is to
      enable easier importing of the data to other applications.
