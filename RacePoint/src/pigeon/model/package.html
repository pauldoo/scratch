      These classes maintain the information accumulated
      during a racing season and are written out to file when the user saves.
      
      No (or at least very little) calculation goes on within these classes.
      <p/>
      Changing these classes may result in incompabilities when loading files saved
      with different versions of the application. 
      <p/>
      All of these model classes are immutable which I believe makes using them
      safer and easier.
